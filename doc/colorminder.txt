INTRODUCTION                                                  *colorminder*

This plugin has vim remember color scheme changes automatically so that
it gets loaded on subsequent starts of vim.

It (mostly) eliminates the need to make changes to your .vimrc file every you
change color schemes -- which can be convenient when your .vimrc is source controled.

FEATURES                                             *colorminder-features*

* Remembers gui and terminal vim color schemes seperately.

That's about it so far.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                   *colorminder-configuration*

Following are some options that can be set.

*g:colorminder_scheme_default_gui*
   Default color scheme to use in gui vim if one has not been set before.
   Useful when first using the plugin or moving to a new computer.
   Example: >
      let g:colorminder_scheme_default_gui = "hybrid"

*g:colorminder_scheme_default_term*
   Default color scheme to use in terminal vim if one has not been set before.
   Useful when first using the plugin or moving to a new computer.
   Example: >
      let g:colorminder_scheme_default_term = "jellybeans"

*g:colorminder_last_colorscheme_file*
   Path to the file to store color schemes used on startup. If the default for
   this file is under source control you should specify another location for
   the file.
   Default: ~/.vim/.colorminder_last_colorscheme

==============================================================================
ISSUES                                          *colorminder-issues*

Does not handle any additional settings a color scheme may require.  For
example, if a theme has both dark and light versions and that is controlled by
setting background, you will have to ensure background is set in your .vimrc
per your preference.
